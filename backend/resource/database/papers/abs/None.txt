Unified Shape and SVBRDF Recovery using Differentiable Monte Carlo  Rendering
  Reconstructing the shape and appearance of real-world objects using measured2D images has been a long-standing problem in computer vision. In this paper,we introduce a new analysis-by-synthesis technique capable of producinghigh-quality reconstructions through robust coarse-to-fine optimization andphysics-based differentiable rendering.  Unlike most previous methods that handle geometry and reflectance largelyseparately, our method unifies the optimization of both by leveraging imagegradients with respect to both object reflectance and geometry. To obtainphysically accurate gradient estimates, we develop a new GPU-based Monte Carlodifferentiable renderer leveraging recent advances in differentiable renderingtheory to offer unbiased gradients while enjoying better performance thanexisting tools like PyTorch3D and redner. To further improve robustness, weutilize several shape and material priors as well as a coarse-to-fineoptimization strategy to reconstruct geometry. We demonstrate that ourtechnique can produce reconstructions with higher quality than previous methodssuch as COLMAP and Kinect Fusion.
Multi-view Image-based Hand Geometry Refinement using Differentiable  Monte Carlo Ray Tracing
  The amount and quality of datasets and tools available in the research fieldof hand pose and shape estimation act as evidence to the significant progressthat has been made.However, even the datasets of the highest quality, reportedto date, have shortcomings in annotation. We propose a refinement approach,based on differentiable ray tracing,and demonstrate how a high-quality publiclyavailable, multi-camera dataset of hands(InterHand2.6M) can become an evenbetter dataset, with respect to annotation quality. Differentiable ray tracinghas not been employed so far to relevant problems and is hereby shown to besuperior to the approximative alternatives that have been employed in the past.To tackle the lack of reliable ground truth, as far as quantitative evaluationis concerned, we resort to realistic synthetic data, to show that theimprovement we induce is indeed significant. The same becomes evident in realdata through visual evaluation.
Road Damage Detection using Deep Ensemble Learning
  Road damage detection is critical for the maintenance of a road, whichtraditionally has been performed using expensive high-performance sensors. Withthe recent advances in technology, especially in computer vision, it is nowpossible to detect and categorize different types of road damages, which canfacilitate efficient maintenance and resource management. In this work, wepresent an ensemble model for efficient detection and classification of roaddamages, which we have submitted to the IEEE BigData Cup Challenge 2020. Oursolution utilizes a state-of-the-art object detector known as You Only LookOnce (YOLO-v4), which is trained on images of various types of road damagesfrom Czech, Japan and India. Our ensemble approach was extensively tested withseveral different model versions and it was able to achieve an F1 score of0.628 on the test 1 dataset and 0.6358 on the test 2 dataset.
D-DARTS: Distributed Differentiable Architecture Search
  Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) is one of the most trending NeuralArchitecture Search (NAS) methods. It drastically reduces search cost byresorting to weight-sharing. However, it also dramatically reduces the searchspace, thus excluding potential promising architectures. In this article, wepropose D-DARTS, a solution that addresses this problem by nesting neuralnetworks at the cell level instead of using weight-sharing to produce morediversified and specialized architectures. Moreover, we introduce a novelalgorithm that can derive deeper architectures from a few trained cells,increasing performance and saving computation time. In addition, we alsopresent an alternative search space (DARTOpti) in which we optimize existinghandcrafted architectures (e.g., ResNet) rather than starting from scratch.This approach is accompanied by a novel metric that measures the distancebetween architectures inside our custom search space. Our solution reachescompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. Code and pretrainedmodels can be accessed at https://github.com/aheuillet/D-DARTS.
Unsupervised Image Segmentation using Mutual Mean-Teaching
  Unsupervised image segmentation aims at assigning the pixels with similarfeature into a same cluster without annotation, which is an important task incomputer vision. Due to lack of prior knowledge, most of existing model usuallyneed to be trained several times to obtain suitable results. To address thisproblem, we propose an unsupervised image segmentation model based on theMutual Mean-Teaching (MMT) framework to produce more stable results. Inaddition, since the labels of pixels from two model are not matched, a labelalignment algorithm based on the Hungarian algorithm is proposed to match thecluster labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model isable to segment various types of images and achieves better performance thanthe existing methods.
